### 4. Graphical user interface with out using comment prompt with the help of vs code tool

1. add & commit using VS code tool.

- VS code -> File Explorer -> Source code -> (M-Indicates modified) (Instead of using git add .) -> point the curser on changes -> You can see "+" symbol -> files are changed to staged changes ->(Instead of using git commit -m "your msg") In the message type your msg -> and then press on Tick button.

### 7. What is Branch in Git Version management ?

- When you create a repository "main branch" will automatically created. You can commit "n" no.of times. This is only Good for (single user) when you only doing the whole project.
- But this way is not good for (multiple user) / group project.
- Why because you cann't identify the commits properly.
- So to avoid this issue get the copy of main branch and named as "for eg: feature 1(eg:Home) , feature 2(eg:About), feature 3(eg:contact)... make changes and then merge it one by one.
- This features are branch.

1.  merge feature 1 with main branch run it/ check it out the output ok or not.
2.  Then merge feature 2 with (main branch & feature 1) run it/ check it out the output ok or not.
3.  Then merge feature 3 with (main branch & feature 1 & feature 2) run it/ check it out the output ok or not.

### Single User

- Main -> Feature -> Main

### Multiple User

- Main ->

1.  Feature 1 -> (Feature 1 Merge with Main) -> Testing taking place
2.  Feature 2 -> (Feature 2 Merge with Main) -> Testing taking place
3.  Feature 3 -> (Feature 3 Merge with Main) -> Testing taking place

- Main (Final Product)

### In Companies

- Main -> Stage (Client/Senior) -> Dev (Developer) ->
- Feature.1 -> (Feature.1 Merge with Dev) -> Testing taking place
- Feature.2 -> (Feature.2 Merge with Dev) -> Testing taking place
- Feature.3 -> (Feature.3 Merge with Dev) -> Testing taking place
- Feature.4 -> (Feature.4 Merge with Dev) -> Testing taking place
- Feature.5 -> (Feature.5 Merge with Dev) -> Testing taking place
- (Final Dev) -> (Final Dev Merge with Stage) Stage -> Testing taking place -> (Final Stage Merge with Main)-> Testing taking place -> Main (Final Product)
